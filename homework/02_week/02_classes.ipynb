    "1. Circle Class (2 points)\n",
    "============\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to create a class that represents a simple circle.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Circle can be defined by either specifying the radius or the diameter,\n",
    "and the user can query the circle for either its radius or diameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other abilities of a Circle instance:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Compute the circle's area\n",
    " * Print the circle and get something nice\n",
    " * Be able to add two circles together\n",
    " * Be able to compare two circles to see which is bigger\n",
    " * Be able to compare to see if there are equal\n",
    " * (follows from above) be able to put them in a list and sort them\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also use:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - properties\n",
    "  - a classmethod\n",
    "  - a define a bunch of \"special methods\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1:\n",
    "-------\n",
    "\n",
    "create class called ``Circle`` -- it's signature should look like::\n",
    "\n",
    "  c = Circle(the_radius)\n",
    "\n",
    "The radius is a required parameter (can't have a circle without one!)\n",
    "\n",
    "the resulting circle should have a attribute for the radius::\n",
    "\n",
    "  c.radius\n",
    "\n",
    "So you can do:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >> c = Circle(4)\n",
    "    >> print c.radius\n",
    "    4\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2:\n",
    "-------\n",
    "\n",
    "Add a \"diameter\" property, so the user can get the diameter of the circle:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >> c = Circle(4)\n",
    "    >> print c.diameter\n",
    "    8\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3:\n",
    "-------\n",
    "\n",
    "Set up the diameter property so that the user can set the diameter of the circle:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >> c = Circle(4)\n",
    "    >> c.diameter = 2\n",
    "    >> print c.diameter\n",
    "    2\n",
    "    >> print c.radius\n",
    "    1\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE** that the radius has changed!\n",
    "Look at `@property` decorator\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4:\n",
    "--------\n",
    "\n",
    "Add an ``area`` property so the user can get the area of the circle:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >> c = Circle(2)\n",
    "    >> print c.area\n",
    "    12.566370\n",
    "\n",
    "(``pi`` can be found in the math module)\n",
    "\n",
    "The user should not be able to set the area:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >> c = Circle(2)\n",
    "    >> c.area = 42\n",
    "    AttributeError\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 5:\n",
    "-------\n",
    "\n",
    "Add an \"alternate constructor\" that lets the user create a Circle directly\n",
    "with the diameter:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >> c = Circle.from_diameter(8)\n",
    "    >> print c.diameter\n",

    "    >> print c.radius\n",
    "    4\n",
    "    \n",
    "**NOTE**: Look at `@classmethod`\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 6:\n",
    "-------\n",
    "\n",
    "Add __str__ and __repr__ methods to your Circle class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can print it:\n",

    "\n",
    "    In [6]: d\n",
    "    Out[6]: Circle(4)\n",

    "Step 7:\n",
    "--------\n",
    "\n",
    "Add some of the numeric protocol to your Circle:\n",
    "\n",
    "You should be able to add two circles:\n",

    "\n",
