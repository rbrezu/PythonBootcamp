# Python Bootcamp

## Introduction

Python is a modern, robust, high level programming language. It is very easy to pick up even if you are completely new to programming. 

Python, similar to other languages like matlab or R, is interpreted hence runs slowly compared to C++, Fortran or Java. However writing programs in Python is very quick. Python has a very large collection of libraries for everything from scientific computing to web services. It caters for object oriented and functional programming with module system that allows large and complex applications to be developed in Python. 

## Installation

You will have a few prerequisites before starting this tutorial:

* Install [Git](install_git.md) 
* Install [Python](install_python.md)
* Login with your Git account on our [JupyterHub](https://jhub.whitesoftware.ro) for homework

## Contents

This course is broken up into a number of weeks (chapters).
You can view the files as html or can interact with them using jupyter notebook.
